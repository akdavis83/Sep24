  <h1>9.1.24</h1>
<h2>
  Stay on fire for Jesus everyday. The Word is the wood, Holy Spirit is the oil and the fire.
</h2>
</div>
<div>
  <h1>9.2.24</h1>
<h2>
  Don't feel sorry for the Lord on the cross, feel sorry for those who put Him there. Don't feel sorry for the persecuted saints, feel compassion and God's burden for the lost that do not know Him yet.
</h2>
</div>
<div>
  <h1>9.3.24</h1>
<h2>
  (Proverbs 16:7) When a manâ€™s ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.</h2>
</div>
<div>
  <h1>9.4.24</h1>
<h2>
  What can wash away my sin? Nothing but the blood of Jesus! What can make me whole again? Nothing but the blood of Jesus! Oh precious is the flow, that makes me white as snow. No other fount I know, nothing but the blood of Jesus!
</h2>
</div>
<div>
  <h1>9.5.24</h1>
<h2>
  (Luke 22:66-71) And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying, 67 Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe: 68 And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go. 69 Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God. 70 Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am. 71 And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.
</h2>
</div>
<div>
  <h1>9.6.24</h1>
<h2>
  (2 Cor 10:12-13) For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise. 13 But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you.
</h2>
</div>
<div>
  <h1>9.7.24</h1>
<h2>
  Are you a guide to the blind but still stumbling around in the darkness? If the blind leads the blind they will both fall into the same pit.
</h2>
</div>
<div>
  <h1>9.8.24</h1>
<h2>
 The Jews were divided over Jesus: They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind. 14 And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes. 15 Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see. 16 Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them. (John 9:13-16)
</h2>
</div>
<div>
  <h1>9.9.24</h1>
<h2>
 The key to spiritual fruitfulness or spiritual blindness is found in 1 Pt 1:5-9: (1 Pt 1:5-9) And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; 6 And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; 7 And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity. 8 For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. 9 But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.
</h2>
</div>
<div>
  <h1>9.10.24</h1>
<h2>
  Don't let your horror story be the reason why you can't serve God and accept Jesus Christ, it will turn into an eternal nightmare!
</h2>
</div>
<div>
  <h1>9.11.24</h1>
<h2>
  The gospel is more than morality, hell is full of good people that were too good to receive Jesus as Lord and Savior. It's nice to be nice but heaven requires righteousness and the perfect holiness that Jesus has made available. Heaven is full of people that realize they did not deserve to be there.
</h2>
</div>
<div>
  <h1>9.12.24</h1>
<h2>
  (Lk 24:36-40) And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. 37 But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit. 38 And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts? 39 Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have. 40 And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet.
</h2>
</div>
<div>
  <h1>9.13.24</h1>
<h2>
  The more you press in, the more the oil starts to flow. Revelation, anointing, glory, fire, joy, boldness, the Holy Ghost. You can never overdose on the Holy Ghost, the more you eat the hungrier you will get.
</h2>
</div>
<div>
  <h1>9.14.24</h1>
<h2>
  (Heb 9:11-14) But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building; 12 Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us. 13 For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh: 14 How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
</h2>
</div>
<div>
  <h1>9.15.24</h1>
<h2>
  The power of sin is broken off of your life, Christ was manifested to trample the serpent under His feet and under your feet, in the precious and powerful name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth: (1 John 3:8) He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.
</h2>
</div>
<div>
  <h1>9.16.24</h1>
<h2>
  Everyone has a regret from the past, don't let the guilt, burden, and shame weigh down your glorious future in Christ. (Isaiah 54:4) Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more.
</h2>
</div>
<div>
  <h1>9.17.24</h1>
<h2>
  Rooting your identity in what you do instead of who you are in Christ is a set up for a major disappointment or potential fall later on down the road. (Col 2:6-7) As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him: 7 Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving. 
</h2>
</div>
<div>
  <h1>9.18.24</h1>
<h2>
  What we do is closely connected to who we are but it is not who we really are. Roles change, functions and activities can break down and if your identity is in the good things you have and do alone, when they start to go or are gone so is the identity you have established. Christ is the only Rock upon which to stand!
</h2>
</div>
<div>
  <h1>9.19.24</h1>
<h2>
  (Mt 7:24-25) Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock: 25 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.
</h2>
</div>
<div>
  <h1>9.20.24</h1>
<h2>
  He is the Potter, we are the clay, molded and shaped after His plan, will and way! (Isaiah 64:8) But now, O LORD, thou art our father; we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand.
</h2>
</div>
<div>
  <h1>9.21.24</h1>
<h2>
  The Jews were not able to leave Jesus alone: (John 8:20-22) These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come. 21 Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come. 22 Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.
</h2>
</div>
<div>
  <h1>9.22.24</h1>
<h2>
  Don't get upset, don't get emotional, just pray! Lashing out, attacks, hostilities are souls that are secretly crying out for prayer, they just aren't aware of this spiritual reality. Scripture says: (Matthew 5:44) But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;
</h2>
</div>
<div>
  <h1>9.23.24</h1>
<h2>
  (Galatians 6:9) And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.
</h2>
</div>
<div>
  <h1>9.24.24</h1>
<h2>
  In the face of the worst case of injustice known to mankind Jesus prayed: Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. (Luke 23:34) This is what true faith looks like even in the midst of the worst situations any person could ever encounter.
</h2>
</div>
<div>
  <h1>9.25.24</h1>
<h2>
On a human level, from the natural point of view, and in modern day terms, the Jews put a hit out on their Messiah because He didn't conform to their ways, when they should have been conforming to His ways!
</h2>
</div>
<div>
  <h1>9.26.24</h1>
<h2>
  (Luke 22:3-6) Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve. 4 And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them. 5 And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money. 6 And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude.
</h2>
</div>
<div>
  <h1>9.27.24</h1>
<h2>
  (Heb 10:26-29) For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, 27 But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries. 28 He that despised Mosesâ€™ law died without mercy under two or three witnesses: 29 Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?
</h2>
</div>
<div>
  <h1>9.28.24</h1>
<h2>
  Sin is mostly vertical, more so than it is horizontal. It's not against another, it's against God's word, will, Son, and way. As David repented and confessed his sin to God he expressed this spiritual reality saying: Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest. (Ps 51:4)
</h2>
</div>
<div>
  <h1>9.29.24</h1>
<h2>
  Joseph was the first one to grasp the revelation of how our sin is not against others and that our actions are not primariy horizontal between each other saying: (Genesis 39:9) There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?
</h2>
</div>
<div>
  <h1>9.30.24</h1>
<h2>
  (1 Cor 2:7-8) But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory: 8 Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
